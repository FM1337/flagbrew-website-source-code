## Info

This is the source code for the final version of the [FlagBrew](https://github.com/FlagBrew) website.

I hosted the website for FlagBrew from 2019 until Feb 2025.

Since some people were asking to see how bad it was, I figured I'd publish it (with some stuff (including clean up of a few comments) redacted of course).

Yes, I know the code is terrible, I have absolutely improved since then, but never really had time to rewrite this site and since I've retired from Flagbrew, I figured now would be the best time to finally publish this code, if nothing more than to act as an example of what **NOT** to do.

Also, before anyone asks, yes I very much do regret using mongodb for the database, it was a terrible idea.

### Original Description 
```markdown
# Flagbrew Website

The website files for the new flagbrew website

# Commit messages

~~From now on, commit messages should contain information about what was changed in the commit rather than a commit message like "backing up now" which is what I used to do~~

# Testing

~~For the time being, any database tests will require an actual database running, in the future this will be fixed by mocking (once I learn how to do it)~~

Welp I failed that didn't I?
